## Introduction

When I started to learn distributed computing I faced an issue: how can I simulate a learning distributed environment on 
my machine? After searching for a while, I found that there wasn't a free and open-sourced project that delivered such 
environment with a great user experience.

> This project is all about this search!

The main goal of **Cluster Apps on Docker** project is to delivery a learning environment for distributed technologies
on your machine that keeps their distributed nature while providing an awesome user experience, all built on top of our
big-blue-water-mammal best friend, Docker! :whale2:
